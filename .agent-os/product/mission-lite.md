# Product Mission (Lite)

Airtable Event Manager is a Python-powered automation system that helps webinar organizers centralize event management by integrating Airtable with Zoom, NationBuilder, and Mighty Networks, eliminating manual data entry across multiple Google Forms and spreadsheets.

This system serves webinar coordinators who manage 5-15 events monthly and currently waste 3-5 hours per week manually transferring data between disconnected systems. Unlike generic event management platforms, Airtable Event Manager is purpose-built for the webinar-to-community workflow, automatically syncing event data across Zoom, NationBuilder, and Mighty Networks while maintaining a centralized speakers database for effortless repeat bookings.
