# DA Event Management System - Development Progress

**Project Start Date:** September 28, 2025
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete
**Last Updated:** September 28, 2025

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Foundation & Airtable Setup ✅

#### 1.1 Requirements Gathering & Planning

**Completed:**
- Analyzed existing Google Forms workflow (Event Request Form, Webinar Intake Form)
- Reviewed sample data from:
  - `DA Global Event Request 2024 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv` (11 fields, 10 events)
  - `DA Webinar Intake Form (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv` (18 fields, multiple speakers)
- Identified 17 workflow tasks that need tracking
- Documented current pain points:
  - Manual data transfer between forms and spreadsheets (3-5 hours/week)
  - No centralized task tracking
  - Difficulty reusing speaker information
  - Limited reporting capabilities

**Deliverables:**
- `.agent-os/product/mission.md` - Product vision and goals
- `.agent-os/product/mission-lite.md` - Condensed version
- `.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md` - Technical architecture
- `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` - 4-phase development plan
- `.agent-os/product/airtable-schema.md` - Complete database schema
- `.agent-os/product/email-automation-plan.md` - Email automation architecture
- `.agent-os/specs/phase1-airtable-schema-setup.md` - Implementation specification

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. All Events in Eastern Time
**Decision:** Removed separate timezone field, all events use ET
**Rationale:** Current workflow uses only ET, simplifies scheduling
**Impact:** Event Time field is text format "9:00 AM" (assumed ET)

### 2. Single Status Field for Approval
**Decision:** Removed redundant "Approval Status" field
**Rationale:** "Status" and "Approval Status" created confusion
**Impact:** Clearer workflow, single source of truth

### 3. NationBuilder as Website
**Decision:** Removed duplicate "Website Posted" fields
**Rationale:** NationBuilder is the primary website platform
**Impact:** NationBuilder fields track website posting

### 4. Email Communications Table
**Decision:** Created dedicated table instead of just checkboxes
**Rationale:** Need to track templates, recipients, delivery status
**Impact:** Comprehensive email audit trail and analytics

### 5. Manual Task Creation (Phase 1)
**Decision:** Tasks created manually, automation deferred to Phase 2
**Rationale:** Validate workflow before automating
**Impact:** ~20 minutes manual work per event initially

### 6. Forms Replace Google Forms
**Decision:** Use Airtable native forms instead of custom forms
**Rationale:** Faster implementation, no additional hosting needed
**Impact:** Some limitations vs custom forms, but immediate value

### 7. Speaker Table Name
**Decision:** Named table "Speakers" not "Speakers Database"
**Rationale:** Simpler table name, easier API access
**Impact:** Cleaner code, less typing

### 8. Gmail API over SendGrid
**Decision:** Use Gmail API with Google Workspace for emails
**Rationale:** Zero additional cost, better deliverability from DA domain
**Impact:** More complex initial setup, but no monthly fees
